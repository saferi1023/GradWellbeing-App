# GradWellbeing â€“ App  
> **Well-being of Graduate Students with AI-Based Monitoring**

GradWellbeing is a cross-platform mobile application for collecting multimodal well-being data from graduate students. The app passively records GPS, step count, and sleep patterns, and securely syncs data to Firebase/Firestore while integrating Microsoft Graph (Teams, Outlook, Calendar) to capture occupational interactions for later analysis.

These datasets power our [**JDR-LLM**](https://github.com/saferi1023/JDR-LLM) research, where we apply large-language-model analysis to simulate JD-R scores and investigate graduate student well-being patterns.

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**  
  Email-based sign-in and institutional login (Microsoft / Azure) for protected data access.

- **JD-R Model Questionnaire**  
  5-point Likert-scale questions to assess perceived stress, peer support, supervision, infrastructure, and intellectual climate.

- **Daily Sync & Data Retrieval**  
  Retrieve occupational digital data (chat messages, emails, and calendar schedules) directly using Microsoft Graph API.

- **File Uploads**  
  Upload schedule or transcript files with custom date selection for AI processing.

- **AI-Based Insights**  
  Collected data is processed by a Python/LLM pipeline to estimate weekly JD-R scores.

## Key App Tabs

### 1. Questionnaire Tab
Students can fill out and submit a **JD-R based questionnaire** consisting of **5 categories** (Perceived Stress, Peer Support, Supervision, Infrastructure, Intellectual Climate) with a **total of 26 Likert-scale questions**.  
Upon completion, all responses are securely stored in **Firestore Cloud** for later analysis.

### 2. Sync Tab
Through the **Sync** tab, students can:
- Securely log in using their **institutional ID** via Microsoft authentication.
- Retrieve and upload:
  1. **Chat messages** with their advisor  
  2. **Emails**  
  3. **Calendar schedules**

This process allows fine-grained, privacy-aware syncing of academic interaction data.

### 3. Upload Tab
Students can also report **additional documents** (e.g., schedules or transcript files) through the **Upload** tab.  
Users select the file type, assign a date, and upload the document, which is then securely stored in Firestore for research analysis.
